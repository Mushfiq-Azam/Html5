                <h5>Introduction: My Trip to ISSB</h5>
                <p>Hello and welcome to my website — My Trip to ISSB!
This is where I share my full experience of attending the Inter Services Selection Board (ISSB). From the moment I got the call letter to the final day, I’ve documented it all — raw and real. Whether you’re a future candidate or just curious, I hope my journey helps and inspires you.</p>

                <h5>How I Prepared</h5>
                <p>
        Preparation wasn’t just about studying — it was about discipline.
I focused on four areas:

Physical fitness (running, pushups, situps)

Mental strength (daily meditation and confidence-building)

Knowledge (current affairs, defense-related topics)

Communication (group discussions and public speaking)

I also practiced ISSB-specific tests like WAT, TAT, and Situation Reaction Tests regularly.

                     My Day-by-Day ISSB Experience
                </h5>
                <p>Day 1: Reporting & document checking — everything felt serious from the start.
Day 2: Psychological tests — rapid-fire writing, time pressure, and full focus.
Day 3: GTO tasks — teamwork, leadership, and staying calm under pressure.
Day 4: Interview — personal questions, quick thinking, and honesty.
Day 5: Conference — the final moment. A mix of fear, hope, and satisfaction.</p>

                <h5> What I Learned</h5>
                <p>The ISSB journey taught me a lot more than I expected:

Discipline is not optional.

Confidence is key — even more than having the right answer.

Teamwork matters as much as individual performance.

Most importantly: Know yourself, believe in yourself.

                <h5>Tips for Future Candidates</h5>
                <p>Here’s my quick advice if you’re planning to go to ISSB:

Be yourself. Don’t fake anything.

Stay fit — physically and mentally.

Improve your speaking skills.

Stay updated on national and international issues.

Respect your teammates. You’re not competing against them — you’re being tested with them.</p>
